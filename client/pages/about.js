        <p className="fluff">
            Created in Fall 2020 by twins Garrett and Aaron, the UCR CompSci Discord server grew to be a hub for students studying computer science, computer engineering,
            electrical engineering, and more, as well as attracting the occasional outsider interested in the various programs at UCR. 
        </p>
        <p className="fluff">
            This bot and website was created at Citrus Hack 2022 with the help of Richard and Raymond as part of an effort to improve the process of receiving roles and accessing student-made servers for various courses.
